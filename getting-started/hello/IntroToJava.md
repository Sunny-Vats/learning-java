## Hello World Program

- In this program, we have declared a template, or class in programming language words, to map a real world greeting. The word `class` is a keyword and should not be used as a function name, variable name or any user defined class name.

- Next, is the class name, which is user defined. Naming a class has certain rules:
    1. Class Name with multiple words should begin with an uppercase. (e.g: class name 'Hello' and 'HelloWorld' both are valid and are considered as good practise)

    2. It should not start with any number or special character except ` $ ` or ` _ `.

    3. It should not have space in between multiple words.

    4. A class name should have a meaningful name.

    5. File and class name should be same, if class is public.

    6. A program can have only one public class.

- After class name, an opening curly braces token is used ` { `. This marks the beginning of a class.

- A class might have an access-specifier preceeding `class` keyword. In our program we have used `public` access-specifier with our class `Hello` and hence file name to be used `Hello` is now mandatory with extension `.java`.

- Inside class, we have a function as an instruction what class should do.
