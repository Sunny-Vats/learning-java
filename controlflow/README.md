# CONTROL FLOW

A control flow is the order in which each statements are going to be executed.

## Control Flow Statements

**Control Flow Statements**
: The Control Flow Statements allow certain statements to execute based on valid conditions on *runtime*. If the conditions to be fulfilled are turned out to be `false`, then the statements will not be executed and the flow is, thus, controlled.

## Types of Control Flow Statements

There are three types of Control Flow Statements:

1. **Selection Statements**
: These statements enable you to select a path or route of execution based on your valid conditions.

2. **Iterative Statements**
: These statements allow you to execute a statement or set of statements for a certain number of times. These statements create a loop of certain cycles until terminated and can be intentionally looped infinitely.

3. **Jump Statements**
: These statements breaks the normal flow of sequentially executing code and transfer the control to another part of program.

### Selection Statements

The Selection Statement allows a program to execute a path based on valid condition. There are five Selection Statements:

1. if statements
2. if-else-if statements
3. Nested if statements
4. switch statements
5. Nested switch statements
